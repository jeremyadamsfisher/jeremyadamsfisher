## Hello there!

I am a software developer passionate about reproducible science and clean, scalable code. Currently, I am pursuing a Masters in Computational Biology at Carnegie 
Mellon University (School of Computer Science). Prior to grad school, I worked on the BD Rhapsody Single-Cell Analysis System. I expect to graduate in May, 2021.
